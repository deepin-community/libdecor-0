libdecor-0 (0.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Christian Rauch ]
  * New upstream release
    - Drop all patches, included in the upstream release
  * Update private symbols

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Distinguish between public and private symbols.
    To do this, generate the .symbols file from a template, so that the
    private symbols generate a lockstep dependency on the current binary
    version.
  * Update autopkgtest.
    Now that more symbols used in the demo programs are auto-discovered,
    the autopkgtest needs to copy config.h from a libdecor build.
  * Standards-Version: 4.6.1 (no changes required)

  [ Debian Janitor ]
  * Remove constraints unnecessary since buster
    - Build-Depends: Drop versioned constraint on meson and
      wayland-protocols
